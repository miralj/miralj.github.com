Wisconsin State Senator <a href="http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/vinehout/Pages/default.aspx">Kathleen Vinehout</a>  (D-WI 31<sup>st</sup> District) is emerging as a possible contender in the upcoming Wisconsin gubernatorial race. Now that former Trek Bicycle executive Mary Burke (D) has thrown her hat into the ring, state Democrats are wondering who has the best chance of taking down Republican Governor Scott Walker. Rumors abound that Vinehout will make an announcement soon.</p>
<p>You can ask Senator Vinehout yourself at the <b>2013 Flyway Film Festival</b>’s opening night “Kickoff Gala” on <b>Thursday, October 17 at 6:00pm</b>. Vinehout, an ardent supporter of the arts in Wisconsin, will make opening remarks before the keynote speech and awards ceremony. She will also be present to answer questions after the Festival&#8217;s closing night film <a href="http://flywayfilmfestival.org/2013/film/citizen-koch/"><em><strong>Citizen Koch</strong></em></a>, a controversial documentary about big money in Wisconsin politics. <em>Citizen Koch</em> will screen at 7:00pm on Sunday, October 20th, at the <a href="http://flywayfilmfestival.org/2013/venues/">Widespot Performing Arts Center</a> in Stockholm, WI.</p>
<p>The Kickoff Gala will take place at <a href="http://www.villabellezza.com/">Villa Bellezza</a>, a new Mediterranean-style villa and winery in Pepin, Wisconsin. The evening will begin with a reception of hors d’oeuvres and 2013 signature Flyway cocktails, featuring Twin Cities-based <a href="http://www.joialife.com/">Joia</a> sodas, organic <a href="http://prairievodka.com/">Prairie vodka</a>, and other local brews.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based <b>Emily Best</b> will deliver the keynote speech.  Best is the CEO and founder of <a href="http://www.seedandspark.com/">Seed&amp;Spark</a>, a cutting-edge platform for crowdfunding, distribution, and interaction for independent filmmakers.</p>
<p>2013 Flyway Film Festival Director Rick Vaicius will present the awards for best films and accomplishments in several categories. Each winning filmmaker will take home a “<b>Flyway Axe</b>” award designed by <a href="http://www.culverstudio.com/">David Culver</a>, a nationally-recognized artist living in Bay City, Wisconsin. Live music follows the awards ceremony.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://flywayfilmfestival.org/2013/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/07/2013Poster.jpg"><img class="colorbox-25927"  alt="Stockholm Art Fair poster by Glen &quot;Sonny&quot; Nelson" src="http://flywayfilmfestival.org/2013/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/07/2013Poster-300x259.jpg" width="300" height="259" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">2013 Stockholm Art Fair poster by Glen &#8220;Sonny&#8221; Nelson</p></div>
<p class=" wp-image-25943    " style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px; text-align: left;"> Over 40 years ago, some artists from elsewhere settled in the little town of Stockholm, Wisconsin. Because they were hippies, they decided to have a groovy art fair. Because they were talented, they became nationally recognized artists, and their groovy little art fair turned into <a href="http://www.thecountrytoday.com/country_life_main/article_74d79fca-ee58-11e2-831e-001a4bcf887a.html">a big deal</a>.</p>
<p>Around 20 years ago, a cinephile named Rick bought a farmhouse in Pepin. He had heard about all the artists in the area, so he figured it would be a groovy place to live. Because he couldn&#8217;t find enough independent films to watch, he started a screening series in Pepin and Stockholm. Because the screening series was a success, he banded together with other artsy people and turned it into an actual film festival.</p>
<p class=" wp-image-25946 " style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;">When he was a U of M student, Rick volunteered at what was then called the Rivertown Film Festival, in order to get in and see films for free. He learned about film and about what it takes to run a festival. <a href="http://www.focusfeatures.com/article/minneapolis_film_festivals">Al Milgrom</a>, who basically force-fed independent and international films to the Twin Cities public until they learned to like it, started Rivertown (which later became Minneapolis-St. Paul International Film Festival).</p>
<p>So, the answer to the above question is: YES.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here along the Lake Pepin/Mississippi River flyway, we&#8217;re too busy bird-watching to worry about such things as the decimation of the oceanic coastlines. &#8212;I say! Was that a rose-breasted grosbeak? I daresay it was! &#8212;What&#8217;s this about rising sea levels threatening the lives of millions along the coasts? Tut, tut. Look there&#8212;an indigo bunting!</p>
<p><a href="http://shoredupmovie.com/"><em>Shored Up</em></a>, a new documentary directed by Ben Kalina and executive produced by 2009 Flyway keynote speaker <a href="http://www.sub-genre.com/">Brian Newman</a>, is about to shake us out of our ornithological complacency. The film looks at the impacts of a rising sea on coastal communities. Remember Hurricane Sandy? Kalina was already more than three years into shooting his film when that little event pretty much made his point: that our current &#8220;solutions&#8221; to rising sea levels are not working out very well.</p>
<p>The film uses animation, interviews with scientists, surfer footage, and policy debates to tell the story of coastal erosion. As Kalina <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/movies/documentaries-in-the-wake-of-hurricane-sandy.html?_r=1&amp;">told</a> the <em>New York Times</em>, he had been struggling to find powerful imagery for his film when Sandy hit. The moral of that story: be careful what you wish for.</p>
<p>Put <em>Shored Up</em> on your list of must-see films at Flyway 2013. Watch the trailer and wring your hands in distress. Then see below for some pretty pictures of migrating birds on Lake Pepin.</p>
<p>The trailer:</p>

</p>
<p>Segue to birds. The Mississippi River is a &#8220;flyway&#8221; for migrating birds, meaning they follow the river up from Mexico in the spring, and down from Canada in the fall. Lake Pepin is the part where the river widens and slows, so we call it a lake. Birds consider it a commodious rest stop. Of course, the same climate forces that are destroying the coasts are also wreaking havoc on the birds&#8230;and everything else. Well, anyway.</p>
