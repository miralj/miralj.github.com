<br />In her dreams she flew. <br /> Every night, when she closed her eyes, she would wake up in a world where she had the power of flight. She would simply take a step and her body would float into the sky.

And every morning, she'd wake up sure that if she tried hard enough, she could learn to fly in the waking world as well.
</p>
<p>
But she'd take a step and instead of finding weightlessness, she remained glued to the ground.
